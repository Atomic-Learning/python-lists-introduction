<p>Python lists are a way to create and work with ordered collections of items. This page covers Python's specific syntax for creating, accessing, and manipulating lists.</p>

<h2>Creating Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are created using square brackets <code>[]</code> with items separated by commas:</p>

<py-cell>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = ["a", 1, True, 2.5]

print(fruits)
print(numbers)
print(mixed)</py-cell>

<h2>Empty Lists</h2>

<p>You can create an empty list with just empty brackets:</p>

<py-cell>empty_list = []
print(empty_list)</py-cell>

<h2>Lists Can Contain Different Types</h2>

<p>A list can contain items of any type, and even mix types:</p>

<py-cell>mixed_list = ["hello", 42, 3.14, True, [1, 2, 3]]

print(mixed_list)</py-cell>
